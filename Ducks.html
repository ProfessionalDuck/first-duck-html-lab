        <p style="color: burlywood"> When you think of ducks what do you immediately think of? Do you think of their silky feathers, rusted looking bills, or their void like black eyes? I'd think of their feathers, but that's only because I find them everywhere I go. Don't be worried when a duck starts loosing its feathers. It's a natural thing, and almost every duck does it. A cool thing to do if you're bored and have tons of feathers, you can create a wreath with them. It's time consuming, and it'd make a good decoration for Thanksgiving!

        Flying Pattern
        </h2>
        <p style="color: burlywood"> Have you ever noticed the pattern the ducks make when they fly, or at least wondered why they flew that way? Even though ducks may be small, they have strong wings that can allow them to fly for hours on going. The duck that is in the front of the rest of the pattern is being pushed back the most by the wind so they have to work the hardest. The rest of the ducks behind them are keeping shape waiting in line. If the duck in the front cannot handle the wind, they simple go in the back of the pattern. The ducks in the back of the pattern are either really weak and are having issues keeping up with the rest, or they just finished taking the wind for the rest. It's a smart operation for such small ducks. <p/>

        Diet
        </h3>
        <p style="color:burlywood">
         When you think of a duck's diet you might almost immediately think of bread. As bread sounds good, and is easy to get from your counter, it is not the healthiest for ducks. Bread expands in stomachs almost as if it is a sponge. The duck will think it's full, when really it's not. Most ducks have self control I hope, and will stop eating food once they think they are full. If they keep getting fed bread, they could die from starvation.

            Understanding Ducks
        </h4>
        <p style="color:burlywood">
            Ducks don't really have a way to show they can trust someone or any other way most people think. That's not always the case. If a duck trusts you, it will most likely feel comfortable with standing by you while you're sitting. Sometimes though, when a person stands up infront of an animal, the animal gets frightened because, of how big they are, or they might not trust them fully. If the duck thinks of you as a friend or buddy then they will not be frightened when you stand up.
             In order to train them to be more comfortable around you, you can stand up once in a 
            while, and sit back down. This makes them more use to you changing position.
